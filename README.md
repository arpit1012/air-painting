# air-painting
Given the real time webcam data, this paint-like python application uses OpenCV library to track an object-of-interest (a yellow spoon in my case) and allows the user to draw by moving the object, which makes it both awesome and challenging to draw simple things.
This project i made with the help of opencv a python library.
In this project it contain two file one is tracker and other is the air painting file.
so using the tracker file you can find the lower h,s,v and upper h,s,v value for your object which you track in my case it is yellow spoon
so if you want to change the tracking object first using tracker file find upper and lower hsv value and after that replace this value in air painting file in the require variable.
